This project focuses on the analysis of the census-income dataset,
which contains census information for individuals and their income
classification. The dataset contains information for 48,842 individuals,
with 14 attributes including age, workclass, education, marital status,
and more. The target variable is a binary classification of income,
categorized as ">50K" or "<=50K". The report begins by addressing
missing values in the dataset using appropriate techniques. This
involves identifying missing values and implementing strategies such
as imputation or deletion, feature extraction, feature scaling etc.

Three different classifiers are then applied to build prediction models:
NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network
classifiers with 1, 2, and 3 hidden layers. Each model is trained and
tested using a combined dataset, with 67% randomly selected as the
training set and the remaining points used for testing. The
comparative study section provides insights into the performance of
the different classifiers, including the Decision Tree Classifier from
Assignment 1 and the Random Forest algorithm. The optimal classifier
is determined based on its performance metrics, such as accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score, etc.

This project demonstrates the process of building prediction models
using various classifiers. The findings shed light on the effectiveness
of each classifier and identify the optimal classifier for predicting
income levels based on census data.
